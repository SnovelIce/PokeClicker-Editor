uhhh It's 3:30 am... I got nothing good else to do except sleeping...

and like I said in the file description
It's really dead simple the save file is just encoded in base64 then it's just a Json file! so the program just decodes it display the values and let you change then turn it into a json, encode it back to base64 and exports it lol that's it....
